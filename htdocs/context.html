          <h2>The Doha Agreement</h2>
          <!-- Description/Explanation -->
          <hr>
          <p>On the 29th of February 2020, US and Taliban representatives came
            together in Doha to sign an agreement to end the ongoing conflict
            in Afghanistan. In this agreement, both parties agreed on the
            following terms:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The US and other allied nations would gradually withdraw and
              reduce their stationed forces in the following months, with the
              expected completion date on the 1st of May 2021 (however, due to
              delay, the actual dates were on the final days of August).</li>
            <li>In return, the Taliban (formally known as the Islamic Emirate of
              Afghanistan) would not host any organizations or parties nor use
              its resources to pose a defense or security threat to the US and
              other allied nations.</li>
            <li>Finally, negotiations and ceasefire between the Islamic Republic
              of Afghanistan and the Taliban would follow after the withdrawal
              of said forces <a href="#context-ref1">(Agreement for Bringing

          <h2>The 2021 Taliban Offensive</h2>
          <!-- Description/Explanation -->
          <hr>
          <p>In May 2021, while the Western troops were withdrawing, Taliban
            forces began attacking and capturing some of Afghanistan's
            districts. In some areas, the Taliban committed the war crime of
            harming the civilian population.</p>
          <p>From June to July 2021, the Taliban continued their onslaught by
            capturing more districts, territories, and even cities from the
            government. At the same time, US and UK forces continued to withdraw
            from their major military outposts.</p>
          <p>In August 2021, the Taliban won against the government forces.
            Their fighters captured territory after territory in the first weeks
            alone. Eventually, all that was left was to take the seat of power:
            Kabul. However, it did not take them long to capture the capital and
            threw everyone affected (e.g., government, foreign nations,
            citizens, etc.) in a panic.</p>
          <p>With the capital, Kabul, captured, the evacuations now began
